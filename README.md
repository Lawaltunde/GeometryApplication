# GeometryApplication
In this assignment we are to create a basic geometry application. The user will always have access to the square option, but if specific flags are set, they will also have access to the rectangle and triangle options. This assignment will use a console application with dependency injection and feature management setup as in the previous article: https://adamstorr.co.uk/blog/getting-microsoft-feature-management-working-in-a-console-app/

The different shapes will be stored in a class library. And we will also need to create an interface to interact with them.

There will be a testing library to hold the tests for each shape.

There will be a console application that will control access to the shapes and accept user input.
